1a. Create a series of skeletal divs that can recieve a certain amount of props.
	//NAME (ENGLISH TRANSLITERATION/PRONOUNCIATION)
	//IMG (ARABIC WRITING) 
	// Sound Byte (maybe)

1b. have a database of all 99+ cards ability to call them at anypoint (API call?)


1c. Display 9 random cards in a row with side A face up.
	

2. add flipping motion on click. Front side of card displays IMG && transliteration
back of card displays meaning. (I assume some form of state would be used for this to get it to display new info after onlick)

3a. refresh button that allows new number of cards to display.

3b. ability to mark card w/ 1 of 2 options
 	//Option 1 marks card as memorized and will not enter back into the refresh state database
	// option 2 is to mark card as need to repeat so keeps as priority? (this might be more accessible)
